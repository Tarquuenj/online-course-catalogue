Explanation of ERD Diagram
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Online Course Catalog represents the logical structure of the database. It includes the main entities and their relationships:

Users: Represents the individuals using the platform. Attributes include user_id, name, email, and password.

Courses: Represents the courses available on the platform. Attributes include course_id, title, description, and image.

Instructors: Represents the instructors teaching the courses. Attributes include instructor_id, name, bio, and photo.

Enrollments: Represents the enrollment records of users in courses. Attributes include enrollment_id, user_id, course_id, and enrollment_date.

Reviews: Represents the reviews submitted by users for courses. Attributes include review_id, user_id, course_id, rating, and comment.

Relationships
Users and Enrollments: A user can enroll in many courses (one-to-many relationship). Each enrollment record links a user to a course.

Courses and Enrollments: A course can have many enrollments (one-to-many relationship). Each enrollment record links a course to a user.

Users and Reviews: A user can write many reviews (one-to-many relationship). Each review is linked to a user.

Courses and Reviews: A course can have many reviews (one-to-many relationship). Each review is linked to a course.

Courses and Instructors: A course is taught by one instructor, but an instructor can teach many courses (one-to-many relationship).

This ERD helps in understanding the data model and how different entities interact with each other within the application.
